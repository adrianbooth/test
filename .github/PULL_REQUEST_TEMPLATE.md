**Best Practises**

- When adding a comment to request changes, please use Github's `Request Change` option to enforce the changes on the pull request.
- If your PR is composed of a single commit - please "Squash and Merge" and don't forget to add [Major], [Minor] or [Patch] to the merge message
- Version according to [SemVer principles](https://bedegaming.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/444071937/Component+Versioning)
If all the above can be honestly confirmed, then the PR can pass. :shipit:
